# Image Generation Prompt

We used ChatGPT-4o to generate the cards. For each card, it took multiple tries to get the details write, and there might still be typos. You can use the following prompt to generate more images to you specifications. You can also provide one of the existing cards as reference. After the first image generation, you don't have to copy-paste the whole prompt in the same chat. You can start giving card descriptions like the one in the last paragraph.

I'm preparing a "mafia" inspired social deduction game, but with the Standard Model flavor.
It will be matter (The city) vs antimatter (The mafia).
Instead of hanging people we put them in the collider.

Here is a short description of the roles:
Roles - Matter (the city):

Electron - detective - determines the charge of the particle
Photon - watcher - sees all the particles that interacted with a chosen particle during the unobserved phase
Up quark - aware of other matter quarks
Charm quark - aware of other matter quarks
Down quark - outsider - aware of other matter quarks, has negative charge
Electron neutrino - little girl - peeks antimatter while in the unobserved state
W boson - doctor - protects a particle from being put in the collider
Higgs boson - jailer - prevents a particle from being put in the collider and also disables their powers
Muon - insane - puts a particle in the collider of their choice once per game
Tau - vigilante - puts a particle in the collider of their choice each unobserved phase, but if a matter particle is chosen, the Tau decays
Gluon - the amor - binds the quarks to form a hadron
Roles - Antimatter (the mafia):

Anti-up quark - mafia member - regular antimatter
Anti-top quark - mafia boss - antimatter, but has final say in voting
Anti-down quark - godfather - antimatter, but has positive charge
I will now be asking you to generate cards, one at a time, that will be handed out to the players.
The style should all be consistent. The cards should look like this: on the top - the name of the particle is written (eg. Electron/Anti-up quark/Tau/Higgs boson etc.), on the bottom either "Matter" (in green) or "Antimatter" (in purple) is written, in the middle there is the particle. The particle is a ball, which is either red (positive charge), blue (negative charge) or pearly-white (neutral charge), the particle is dressed as their corresponding mafia role with attributes which I will specify. Instead of a face a letter corresponding to the particle is written (eg. "e" for electron or "u" for the up quark, in case of antimatter particles, an overline a displayed on the top of the letter). To the right of the "particle person" their charge is written (1 or 2/3 or 1/3 or 0 or -1/3 or -2/3 or -1). A text banner displaying the description of the role is in the bottom half of the card (above the "Matter"/"Antimatter" banner).

Use the attached image as reference. 

 Let's make the Anti-top quark, part of antimatter. It is mafia boss, so make the icon of a classy mob boss. The charge should be negative 2/3. It's letter should be T with a bar. The description should say "Has final say in colliding".  It should not be holding a baseball bat. Make the face blue.
